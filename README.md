# Seller Churn Prediction – Case Study

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **machine learning for churn prediction** 
in a marketplace / e-commerce seller context.  

The goal is to move from reactive monitoring (dashboards showing what already happened) 
to **proactive interventions** that identify at-risk sellers before they disengage.  

- Predicts churn **one month in advance** with high confidence  
- Provides **interpretable drivers and thresholds** (e.g., sales momentum, session consistency, cancellations)  
- Delivers actionable insights for account management & retention strategy

## 🧪 Methodology
1. **Data preparation** – Engineered seller activity, sales, and operational features.  
2. **Model training** – Compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and LightGBM.  
   - LightGBM chosen for imbalanced dataset handling and explainability.  
3. **Explainability** – SHAP values to identify top churn drivers.  
4. **Risk thresholds** – Derived practical cut-offs for intervention (e.g., sales decline, inactivity).

## 📊 Results (Demo Case)
- Correctly identifies ~**9 out of 10 churners** one month in advance.  
- Balanced performance: Precision ≈ 85%, Recall ≈ 87%, F1 ≈ 0.86.  
- **Top churn drivers**: sales momentum, session consistency, visibility, cancellations.  

---

## 🚀 Key Takeaways
- **Conversion and Activity are the strongest levers** for retention.  
- **Traffic, Operations, Investment** act as enablers, but not standalone fixes.  
- Churn risk increases sharply when multiple signals deteriorate together.

## 🔒 Notes on Data
- This repo uses **dummy datasets** for demonstration.  
- Original dataset and production model are **proprietary and not included**.  
- To reproduce, you can test with open datasets like [Telco Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).
