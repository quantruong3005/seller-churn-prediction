# Executive Summary

This project introduces the **first predictive churn model** for marketplace sellers, 
shifting from reactive monitoring to proactive, data-driven interventions.

## Key Findings
- Predicts churn one month in advance with ~90% confidence.
- **Churn drivers**: Conversion (42%) and Activity (30%) dominate risk.
- **Enablers**: Traffic, Operations, Investment influence churn only when Conversion & Activity weaken.
- Clear thresholds make churn risk tangible (e.g., GMV drop >25%, inactivity >2 days, cancellation >15%).

## Strategic Implications
- AMs/BPOs can now anticipate seller churn early and intervene.
- **Three levers for intervention:**
  1. **Conversion** – recover GMV/order flow (alerts, promos, pricing, product mix).
  2. **Activity** – ensure LS consistency (streak incentives, nudges, onboarding).
  3. **Enablers & Hygiene** – strengthen visibility, enforce low cancellations, selective campaigns.

## Business Impact
- Potential to **reduce churn by ~7pts** (+5% LS selling days protected).
- Pilot rollout OKR: **5pp churn reduction within 3 months** in AM-managed groups.
