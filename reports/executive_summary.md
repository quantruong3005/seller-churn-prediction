# Executive Summary

This project demonstrates the use of **machine learning for churn prediction** 
in an e-commerce / marketplace seller context.  
It represents a shift from reactive monitoring (dashboards showing what already happened) 
to proactive, data-driven interventions that anticipate churn before it occurs.

## Key Findings
- The model predicts churn **one month in advance** with high confidence.  
- **Core churn drivers**: sales momentum and activity consistency.  
- **Enablers**: traffic visibility, operational hygiene, and selective investments.  
- Clear risk patterns were identified, enabling practical thresholds for intervention.

## Strategic Implications
- Account teams can use this approach to anticipate churn early and intervene effectively.  
- **Three levers for intervention:**
  1. **Conversion** – recover sales momentum through promotions, pricing, and product mix.  
  2. **Activity** – maintain seller engagement via session consistency and onboarding.  
  3. **Enablers** – improve visibility, reduce cancellations, apply targeted support programs.  

## Business Impact
- Potential to reduce churn significantly in pilot rollouts, 
protecting a meaningful share of seller sales volume.
