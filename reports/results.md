## Model Performance
- Achieved a strong balance between recall and precision (F1 â‰ˆ 0.85).  
- Able to identify most churners in advance with minimal false alerts.  
- Predictions calibrated at a high threshold to ensure actionable alerts.

## Feature Importance
- **Conversion factors**: sales momentum and order flow.  
- **Activity factors**: seller engagement patterns, session frequency, inactivity gaps.  
- **Traffic**: visibility per session, click-through rates.  
- **Operations**: cancellations, seller tenure.  
- **Investment**: smaller standalone effect.  

## Risk Thresholds
- Sellers with **sharp declines in sales or inconsistent activity** are at highest churn risk.  
- Operational hygiene (low cancellations) and traffic support reduce churn likelihood.
